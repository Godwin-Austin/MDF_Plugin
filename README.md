It is ideal for scenarios where you need to create downloadable PDF documents directly from the WordPress admin dashboard.

### Example PDF Content

- Shaded Boxes
- Images (including watermarks)
- Links

### Customization
Modify the PDF content by editing the HTML code in the `generate_pdf_and_save` function. Adjust the stylesheet to customize layout and styling.

## Plugin Files

- `/assets/css/style.css`: CSS styles for the PDF.
- `/assets/js/js.js`: JavaScript handling frontend PDF generation logic.
- `/vendor/autoload.php`: mPDF library autoloader. Make sure the mPDF library is installed before use.

## Hooks & Actions

- `admin_menu`: Adds the "Download PDF" menu to the WordPress admin panel.
- `admin_enqueue_scripts`: Enqueues necessary JavaScript and CSS files.
- `wp_ajax_generate_pdf`: AJAX action for generating and downloading the PDF.
- `wp_nopriv_ajax_generate_pdf`: AJAX action for generating PDFs for users who are not logged in.

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or higher
- PHP 7.0 or higher
- mPDF library (included via Composer autoload)

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: "PDF Generation Error"**  
  Check error logs if there are errors during PDF generation. The plugin logs errors using `error_log()`.

- **Large File Issues**  
  If the PDF file is large, you may encounter upload limits or timeout issues. To resolve this:
  - Increase PHP upload and execution limits (`upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`, `max_execution_time`).
  - Adjust the `http.postBuffer` size in Git for pushing large files.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for advanced content, like charts and graphs.
- Option to customize watermark position and transparency.
- Integration with other WordPress plugins, such as WooCommerce, for invoices or receipts.
- Improved admin dashboard user interface.
